        <br>For my project I originally planned on making a application that would ask the user to enter multiple nouns and adjectives
            into a list. The program would then randomly pick one of the adjectives or nouns and insert it into the story.
            When tested the project in visual studios and it ran peferfectly fine.</br>

            <br>After running it in visual studios I decided it was time to transfer my github ripositroy into openshift.
            When I ran the bulid I got an error that said "error: provided context directory does not exist: /index".
            I found that the error occured because one of the pods from the cluster was missing a directory in it.
            I believe that with further research into openshift, I might have been able to run the application.
